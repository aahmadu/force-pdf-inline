- No data collection: The extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.
- No analytics: The extension does not include analytics, tracking, or thirdâ€‘party scripts.
- Network access: The extension inspects response headers only to detect PDF content and adjust the `Content-Disposition` header when appropriate. No request or response content is persisted.
